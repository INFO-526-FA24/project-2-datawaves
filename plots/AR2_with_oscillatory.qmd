)

```

The behavior of the two AR(2) processes can be explained by examining their respective coefficients and their effect on the time series dynamics:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 1. AR(2) Process with Coefficients (0.5, -0.4):

#### Equation:

$$
Y_t = 0.5 \cdot Y_{t-1} - 0.4 \cdot Y_{t-2} + e_t 
$$

### Key Observations:

#### Moderate Oscillatory Behavior:

-   The negative $\phi_2 = -0.4$ introduces oscillations in the time series, with values alternating around the mean.
-   The oscillations are moderate because $\phi_1 = 0.5$ is not too large, and the influence of past values decays relatively quickly.

#### Stability:

-   The process is **stable** because the coefficients satisfy the stability condition:

$\phi_2 > -1, \quad \phi_1 + \phi_2 < 1, \quad \phi_1 - \phi_2 < 1$

Here: $-0.4>-1 \quad \text 0.5 +(-0.4) = 0.1 < 1 \quad \text{and} \quad 0.5 - (-0.4) = 0.9 < 1$

#### Behavior:

-   The oscillations decay over time, meaning the process eventually reverts to the mean.
-   The persistence is moderate, with past values influencing the current value for a few time steps before fading.

#### Overall:

-   This process introduces **oscillatory behavior** while remaining stable and moderately persistent.
-   It is a good choice if you want to observe oscillations without excessive persistence.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. AR(2) Process with Coefficients (0.2, -0.7)

### Equation:

$Y_t = 0.2 \cdot Y_{t-1} - 0.7 \cdot Y_{t-2} + e_t$

### Stronger Oscillatory Behavior:

-   The larger negative $\phi_2 = -0.7$ results in **stronger oscillations**, with more pronounced alternations around the mean.
-   The smaller $\phi_1 = 0.2$ means the influence of the most recent past value $(Y_{t-1})$ is weaker, while the second lag $(Y_{t-2})$ dominates the dynamics.

### Stability:

-   The process is also **stable** because the coefficients satisfy the stability condition:

$\phi_2 > -1, \quad \phi_1 + \phi_2 < 1, \quad \phi_1 - \phi_2 < 1$

Here: $-0.7>-1 \quad \text 0.2 +(-0.7) = -0.5 < 1 \quad \text{and} \quad 0.2 - (-0.7) = 0.9 < 1$

### Behavior:

-   The oscillations are more persistent compared to $(0.5, -0.4)$, as the larger magnitude of $\phi_2$ causes the influence of past values to decay more slowly.
-   The process takes longer to revert to the mean, and the oscillations are more pronounced.

### Overall:

-   This process introduces **stronger and more persistent oscillatory behavior**.
-   It is a good choice if you want to emphasize oscillations and persistence in the time series.

## Comparison with Non-Oscillatory Cases

Letâ€™s compare these oscillatory processes to the non-oscillatory cases:

| **Aspect**               | **Non-Oscillatory (0.4, 0.1)** | **Non-Oscillatory (0.7, 0.29)** | **Oscillatory (0.5, -0.4)** | **Oscillatory (0.2, -0.7)** |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Oscillatory Behavior** | None                           | None                            | Moderate                    | Strong                      |
| **Persistence**          | Weak                           | Strong                          | Moderate                    | High                        |

| **Effect of Past**       | Short-lived memory             | Long-lasting memory             | Moderate memory             | Dominated by $Y_{t-2} |
| **Mean Reversion**       | Faster                         | Slower                          | Moderate                    | Slow                        |
| **Fluctuations**         | Small and smooth               | Larger and more persistent      | Alternating and decaying    | Alternating and persistent  |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Conclusion:

Both options are better for demonstrating oscillatory behavior. The choice depends on whether you want **moderate** or **strong oscillations**.

-   **Process 1:** If you want moderate oscillations with faster mean reversion use $(0.5, -0.4)$. This process is stable, introduces oscillations, and has moderate persistence.
-   **Process 2**: If you want stronger oscillations with slower mean reversion use $(0.2, -0.7)$. This process emphasizes oscillatory behavior and persistence, making it more suitable for scenarios where past values have a prolonged influence.
