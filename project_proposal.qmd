## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

### **Final Repository Organization**

-   **data/**: Contains generated datasets and relevant metadata. It includes README, which details dataset parameters and generation processes.

-   **plots/**: Includes static ggplot2 visualizations for AR models (AR(1), AR(2), and AR(3)) with various parameter combinations. README explains each plot and parameter choices.

-   **shiny_app/**: Holds the Shiny app files for interactive plotting of AR models. README provides instructions for using the app and explains the interactive features.

-   **docs/**: Project report, analysis write-ups, and weekly task updates. README outlines project goals, methods, and findings.

-   **project_proposal.qmd:** Project proposal file in qmd format.

-   **project_proposal.pdf**: Project proposal auto generated from project_proposal.qmd

Each folder will contain a README.md file explaining its contents and purpose in the project workflow.
